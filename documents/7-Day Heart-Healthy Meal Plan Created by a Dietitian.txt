A healthy diet and lifestyle are the best weapons to protect against heart disease. In fact, incorporating heart-healthy foods, getting adequate exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, not smoking, avoiding excess alcohol and getting enough quality sleep can have a major impact on reducing cardiovascular disease-related deaths, according to a 2023 review in the Journal of Translational Medicine.

The meals and snacks in this diet plan feature heart-healthy foods, like fiber-rich fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and healthy fats, like olive oil and avocado. Saturated fat, added sugars and sodium—nutrients that can harm your heart when eaten in large amounts—are kept to a minimum. Instead, dishes are seasoned with lots of herbs and spices to keep things flavorful and exciting.

By following this simple 1,200-calorie meal plan, you'll help protect your heart, lose a healthy 1 to 2 pounds weekly and have healthy meals for the week at the ready!
